FRONTEND - MIDDLE-END - BACKEND

- we need a intermediate layer between the client side and microservice
- using this middle end, when client sends request we will be able to make that which microservice
should actually respond to this request
- we can do message validation, response transformation,rate limiting
- we try to prepare an API Gateway that acts as this middle end.
